This script uses the requests module to send HTTP GET requests to each of the specified URLs. 
If the response is successful (i.e. the status code is 200), 
it parses the price from the website's HTML using a parse_price_from_html function, 
which you would need to implement yourself. 
If the response is not successful, it prints an error message.
